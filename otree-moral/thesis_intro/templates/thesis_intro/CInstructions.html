    <p style="text-align: center"><b>Instructions: YOU HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED A SPECIAL ROLE IN THIS EXPERIMENT!</b></p>
    <p>
        <b>You will not be playing the game</b> and are given an alternative task that is described below.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your role in the experiment will be to be an <b>external observer of the game</b>. After every round of the
        game, you will be shown how many of the participants that are playing the game endorsed each New Product (see
        the first screenshot below). Based on that information, you will be asked to <b>assess which New Product
        represents an optimal choice for a participant that wants to earn as much GC as possible</b> in the
        experiment (see the second screenshot below). In other words, your task is to mentally put yourself in the
        shoes of an actual game participant and make the best possible New Product endorsement. Note that <i>your
        choices will not have any actual influence on the game itself</i>.
    </p>

    <br></p>
    <p>
        Additionally, please note that while in <i>Round 1</i> we cannot provide you with actual game participant's
        choices (as they have not made their choices yet), you will still be asked to provide your estimation of what
        you think is the optimal choice. Thus, in this round specifically, base your answer on what you feel like is
        the more attractive product name that an average participant is more likely to choose.
    </p>
    <p>
    In case you have any questions regarding your role in the study, <i>please discretely ask the experimenter now</i>. <br />
    If you feel like you fully understand your role, you may click on the 'Next' button below and begin
    answering questions testing your understanding of the game.
